  Lore: "From an early age, Herman Carter understood the human psyche. To analyse
    and de-construct something as powerful as the brain intrigued him. He was an
    apt pupil and gained the attention of his teachers. He excelled in high-school
    and was published in \"Partisan\" \u2014 a psychology gazette. Within a year,
    Carter was fast-tracked into Yale's advanced neuroscience programme, really a
    front for the CIA. Brainpower is a must if you're about to conquer the world
    and demolish foes across the pond. The CIA understood this, so interrogation
    and intelligence became their number one priority. All they needed were brilliant
    people \u2014 like Carter.\n\r\nCarter and other top-tier recruits were transferred
    off-campus and into a secret black site facility in Illinois known as L\xE9ry's
    Memorial Institute. A prot\xE9g\xE9 craves a mentor, and that's where Dr Otto
    Stamper stepped in, who taught Carter that information is everything and knowledge
    is power. He was given all instruments needed, a guiding hand, and more or less
    everything he asked for. He never realised that sunlight had started to become
    so scarce, that he too was kept in the dark. Because knowledge doesn't only give
    you power, it also transforms you into a threat.\r\n\nTo extract information
    was his mission. Dr Stamper encouraged Carter to go further and not to consider
    this a normal medical facility \u2014 no eyes were watching them, there were
    no rules to abide. The agency just pointed Carter in the right direction, then
    he started to take a few steps back as he saw how Carter could walk on his own.
    Docile test subjects were exchanged for real, live spies. People that played
    a role in the troubles outside the facility. Carter shouldered this new role
    \u2014 Project Awakening took form, and on paper Carter described it as \"experimental
    interrogation\". It was approved and over a few months, nobody knocked on his
    door. Screams and moans filled the corridor outside his lab, but wars skew people
    and what they accept \u2014 as long as the enemy is kept at bay. The fluorescent
    lights flickered more and more often. Electro-convulsive Treatment became a standard
    dish on the menu. Prisoners held at the facility begged the guards to take them
    to any other lab but Carter's. Rumours were disregarded in the beginning.\r\n\nOver
    the years, Carter became known as The Doctor and no one ever questioned if he
    had even held a medical certificate or even what happened to the prisoners after
    they had given up their information. It was only after the L\xE9ry's Memorial
    Institute went silent for a week that they finally uncovered the true horror
    of what had happened there.\r\n\nCarter's experimental information extraction
    had turned to horrific and bizarre torture. Patients and prisoners were found
    dead or in vegetative states with all types of head trauma. In his office, they
    found the most terrible discovery of all. Dr Stamper himself, his head peeled
    open and an array of electrodes and sensors inserted into his still working,
    but annihilated brain. There was no sign of Herman \"The Doctor\" Carter, but
    his research papers suggested that he had been using the prisoners as part of
    awful ECT experiments as he searched for the panacea of mind control.\r\n\nThe
    government didn't want to know. The black site was condemned and all knowledge
    of the L\xE9ry's Memorial Institute redacted forever."
