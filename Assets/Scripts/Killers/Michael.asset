  info: 'The Shape is a haunting Killer, intent on monitoring Survivors from a distance
    to feed his Power. The more he stalks, the stronger and faster he becomes.

    personal Perks, <color=#ffff00>Save the Best for Last</color>, <color=#ffff00>Play
    with Your Food</color>, and <color=#ffff00>Dying Light</color>, select one Survivor
    to become his Obsession and will trigger deadly effects based on the Obsession
    Status.

  Lore: "Michael Myers is one of those seeds. He had no issues with causing the pain
    of others. Instead, it was exactly what he sought. But even life can be tough
    on those with minds filled with terror. The difference is just how one goes about
    to solve those problems. For Michael, he had to kill to find some inner peace.
    As he took his sister\u2019s life, the police found a silent boy dressed as a
    clown at the scene.\r\n\nWhen one stumbles upon a growing fire, one does not
    pour gasoline on it. But this was an action taken by officials that had no idea
    how it would shape this demon in the boy's body. Sending Michael to a mental
    institution was a feeble attempt to save the child. Unsuccessful therapy and
    nightly screams just made him even more introverted and deranged.\r\n\nPeople
    hoped that Michael Myers would end up a parenthesis, soon to be forgotten and
    buried, a failure that soon were to rot away. But then...he escaped."
