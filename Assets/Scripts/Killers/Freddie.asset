  Name: The Nightmare
  scrollHeight: 1760.036
  Lore: "Even while he lived, Freddy Krueger was a creature of nightmares for those
    who truly knew him. Hiding behind a mask of warmth and friendliness, Freddy's
    actual temperament was known only to his victims. When those victims were finally
    heard, the parents of Springwood tracked Freddy down and took the law into their
    own hands. They thought that fire had rid them of a monster that night, that
    their children were finally safe, but evil as strong as his has a way of surviving.\r\n\nYears
    passed, the horror was buried, the victims mercifully forgot. Then, somehow,
    Freddy returned, and dreams became nightmares once again.\r\n\nFreddy focused
    his anger on those he felt had wronged him, building up to his one true obsession,
    Nancy Holbrook. But he underestimated her strength and resourcefulness. Together
    with her friend Quentin Smith, she managed to weaken Freddy, mutilating him and
    leaving him for dead once more.\r\n\nDeath didn't want Freddy the first time
    he encountered it, why did they think it would take him now? He emerged once
    more, consumed with vengeance. Then he turned his sights on the boy who had blocked
    his path to Nancy, his number one.\r\n\nFreddy invaded Quentin's dreams, terrorising
    him night after night, until his strength and defences would be at their lowest.
    When the time was right, he forced the boy to return to the dark reflection of
    Badham Preschool. Here he would have his final revenge.\r\n\nFreddy stalked the
    boy through the school's halls. He took his time, savouring every moment of the
    hunt. This was what he enjoyed the most, the smell of their sweat in the air,
    the ragged gasps of their terrified breath. They were his to toy with.\r\n\nThere
    was the boy, at the end of a long corridor. Too tired and scared to run anymore?
    Resigned to his fate? Freddy closed in, arms wide, claws raking the wall. Their
    tips traced along a pipe, the metallic shrieking only adding to the boy\u2019s
    apprehension.\r\n\nA shower of sparks rained on the ground, and into the liquid
    that covered the tiled floor. A blue flame blossomed and quickly engulfed the
    room.\r\n\nThe boy took flight as Freddy burst from the flames in a fury. Rooms
    and walls raced past in a blur until they were in Freddy's basement. There would
    be no escape from here.\r\n\nSlowly Freddy closed in on the boy. His fear was
    so strong now that Freddy could almost taste it, but his eyes burned with a defiant
    hatred that was almost admirable.\r\n\nFreddy drew back his claws.\r\n\r\nThen
    Freddy felt another presence with him; something old, powerful and dark. A miasma
    enveloped him and the only sensation was a sound like wooden beams flexing and
    creaking in the distance. The echoing groan of metal crushed against metal. Something
    arcane and unknowable, half-way between language and pure terror.\r\n\nA moment
    of falling and spinning and then Freddy was back in the school. But not his school.
    It looked the same, but it felt different. His powers were tempered in some ways
    and focused in others. The boy had gone for now, but another prey walked the
    hallways. Some would be inconsequential; others would become his new favourites.
    All would fall before his claws."
