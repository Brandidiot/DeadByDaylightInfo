  Lore: "A sadistic and merciless executioner, Pyramid Head is fixated on dispensing
    punishment through pain.\r\n\nEncumbered by the steel frame upon his head and
    with a hulking great blade in tow, he stalked the hellish corridors of Silent
    Hill, committed to a duty that no one truly understood. Where he trod, even monsters
    fled for the shadows, and those who crossed his path fell victim to unrestrained
    acts of aggression.\r\n\nWhen his duty was complete and his presence no longer
    needed, he prepared for the long rest \u2014 and yet, his skills were required
    elsewhere. The Fog that streamed over him was somehow different than that he
    was accustomed to in Silent Hill, as if each wisp contained the nerves of a creature,
    writhing, seeking him out.\r\n\nThere was an unspoken agreement in that moment.
    The billowing cloud was an invitation to duty and sadism, and Pyramid Head, taking
    a step into The Fog, accepted his obligation once more."
