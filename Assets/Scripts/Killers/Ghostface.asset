  Name: The Ghostface

  Lore: "Danny Johnson, known as Jed Olsen by some, grabbed the newspaper from the
    kitchen counter: it was a week old, but his face was on the front page, grainy
    and sunken. It was one of those muggy afternoons in Florida when heat and humidity
    permeated everything in the kitchen, making him sweat while standing still. He
    slouched in a damp chair to read. This article had better be good\u2014his work
    in Roseville had been outstanding.\n\nGHOST FACE DISAPPEARS June 18, 1993\r\n\nAt
    first glance, Jed Olsen was a modest and enthusiastic freelancer with experience
    in a variety of small newspapers. The staff at the Roseville Gazette appreciated
    how easy-going and honest he seemed, and so he was treated as a stranger for
    no more than five minutes into his interview:\r\n\n\"Jed quickly spotted the
    editor-in-chief in the room, gave him a wide smile and a firm handshake, and
    talked about good old American values. And that was it, he was in.\" \u2014Ex-Contributor
    at the Roseville Gazette\r\n\nOlsen never justified his erratic career path,
    which zigzagged between several small towns from Utah to Pennsylvania. There
    was no verification of his previous jobs. He had a decent portfolio plus a good
    attitude, and they needed a contributor right away.\n\nTHE ROSEVILLE MURDERS\r\n\nOlsen
    had been working at the newspaper for five months when the Roseville Murders
    began: victims from young to old, stabbed to death in their homes. From the reports,
    the victims seemed chosen at random, yet the killer knew his way around in the
    houses. The multiple stab wounds indicated a personal motive. No traces of DNA
    were found. The local police were confounded: the murders were carried with fury
    akin to a crime of passion yet coldly premeditated.\r\n\nThe murderer also liked
    to stalk his targets. Two victims had reported being followed on their way home
    by a dark figure, a few days prior their death. The killer would follow them
    from Walleyes, a small bar in Northern Roseville, and snap pictures of them at
    home, while looking for a way in. He could watch the same victim for weeks, meticulously
    registering their habits and routines. When he felt the urge to kill, he'd visit
    the most vulnerable victim on his list, and break inside the house quietly.\r\n\nThe
    whole staff worked on the Roseville Murders story. Olsen was often sent to interview
    the family of victims and relay official statements from the police. Unknown
    to everyone at the time, his involvement added to the final body count.\n\nTHE
    GHOST FACE\r\n\nPanic swelled in Roseville when Olsen produced footage of a hooded
    figure breaking into a house at night. The masked face, a white blur in the dark,
    stared at the camera for a second, before disappearing inside. \u201CThe Ghost
    Face Caught on Tape\u201D was the resulting article, written by Olsen. He seemed
    proud of his work at the time, enjoying how the whole town feared his ghost stories.\r\n\nWeeks
    later, Olsen left a note on his work desk and disappeared:\r\n\n\"I hope you
    liked my stories--I enjoyed bringing them to life. Don't worry, I'm not done.\"
    \u2013Jed Olsen\r\n\nThe Roseville law enforcement still refuses to comment as
    Jed Olsen remains at large.\n\nDanny smiled, ripping out the article from the
    newspaper. When the investigation had been pointing to him, he\u2019d packed
    his bags and left Roseville swiftly.\r\n\nHe got up, the clammy seat pulling
    his skin. An oppressive humidity engulfed him as he entered the bedroom. Condensation
    dribbled on a small misted-up window as bits of cracked wallpaper hung limply.
    Its floral pattern was covered with gruesome photos and newspaper headlines.
    Danny pinned the week-old article on top of a picture of lacerated scalps. A
    faint pang of hunger hit him, and he wondered when he had eaten last. Was it
    this morning, while washing his knife and clothes? Or was it last night, after
    following that girl down the street? He couldn't remember clearly.\r\n\nTaking
    a step back, he admired his work on the wall. His mind drifted, remembering all
    the articles he\u2019d written, the stories he\u2019d planned, and the scenes
    he\u2019d brought to life.\r\n\nA shiver ran through him. A chilling breeze transformed
    the bedroom's humidity into an opaque, freezing Fog. A woman shrieked. Dead leaves
    crunched under his feet. He smiled in anticipation."
