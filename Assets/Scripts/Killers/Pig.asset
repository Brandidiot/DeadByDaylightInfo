  Name: The Pig
  scrollHeight: 1386.902
  Lore: 'When John Kramer, better known as Jigsaw, planned for his son to be born
    during the Chinese Zodiac''s Year of the Pig, he wanted it to represent fertility
    and rebirth; a new beginning for him and his wife, and the start of a charmed
    life for his son. But that plan was shattered on the night that a junkie broke
    into his wife''s clinic, hoping to score.


    After this event resulted in
    the death of his unborn son, John finally caught up with the junkie, making him
    his first test subject, and The Pig was changed forever too. It became a representation
    of the disease that was rotting John from the inside, a reminder that we are
    just meat unless we elevate ourselves by our actions, by grasping life from the
    jaws of death. The Pig became a vessel, an agent of Jigsaw, conveying the subjects
    to their test. For some of those who emerged victorious, The Pig could still
    be a rebirth, into their new lives as apprentices, even disciples, of Jigsaw.


    That
    was the case for Amanda Young, a troubled soul, whose life had been a catalogue
    of harm, both to herself and those around her. That changed when she faced, and
    bested, Jigsaw''s test. Deciding her life was worth something, she became devoted
    to Jigsaw''s cause, ready to take over when cancer consumed him.


    But she
    became more dependent on John, her anguish at his impending death combining with
    a belief that their test subjects weren''t capable of saving themselves, of being
    reborn in the crucible of the games.


    Seeing this, John presented her with
    another game, another chance to save herself, but Amanda let her rage and jealousy
    rule her actions. She failed the test and took a bullet as a consequence.


    Bleeding
    out on the tiled floor, darkness engulfed Amanda''s vision, accompanied by a
    sound like creaking wood. Then she was in a forest, once more viewing the world
    through the eyes of a Pig. Trees surrounded her, their branches clawing at her
    from all sides. Waves of panic washed over her and she could hear her breath
    reverberating inside the mask.


    Had she been damned, cursed to spend her
    days here, in this guise? Or maybe this was another test? Maybe she hadn''t failed
    at all? John always thought one step ahead of everyone else, planned for every
    eventuality, and he would never give up on her, surely?


    Jigsaw may have
    gone but he had passed her onto another. A being for whom she would be The Pig
    again.


    Ultimately, she saw now that she had been right in the choices
    she had made. The time for games was over. There was no chance of redemption
    for any of them. They were meat, and meat was destined to die.'
