  Lore: "Designed by Umbrella Corporation, The Nemesis is a nearly unstoppable bio-organic
    weapon fixated on pursuing and eliminating its targets.\r\nPart of the Tyrant
    T-103 series, this specimen has increased intelligence and awareness due to the
    NE-\u03B1 Parasite implanted within it.\r\nIts first mission unleashed it upon
    Racoon City, where it had a singular objective: exterminate S.T.A.R.S. members.\r\nRampaging
    through the city, The Nemesis faced off against Jill Valentine multiple times,
    and though she managed to escape, he was never far behind.\r\nHe nearly had his
    target, when a strange fog descended upon them, mixing with the smoke of a city
    in chaos.\r\nThe phenomenon meant nothing to him\u2014the frigid cold and decreased
    oxygen never posing a threat.\r\nAll that mattered was soldiering on into The
    Fog, continuing the mission: find S.T.A.R.S., exterminate S.T.A.R.S., and kill
    anyone who gets in the way."
