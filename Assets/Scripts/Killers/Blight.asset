  Lore: "To understand the human condition, one must rise above it. This was the
    credo of Talbot Grimes, a Scottish chemist whose unrestrained ambition took him
    to towering heights. As a boy, he was a popular child\u2014bright, charismatic,
    and unafraid to challenge authority\u2014yet despite his social graces he was
    fiercely independent, spending much of his time exploring the sprawling fields
    near his town alone. What began as a child's curiosity nearly turned deadly after
    experimenting with a patch of poisonous foxglove. For days, he laid in bed dripping
    with sweat, purging any food that touched his stomach. When he recovered, it
    wasn't fear that gripped him, but fascination. There was something magical in
    how a single flower could so drastically affect him.\r\n\nInto his adult years,
    his ambition developed as quickly as his questionable methods. He attended the
    London School of Medicine and excelled despite several reprimands. His willingness
    to push the limits secured him a position with the British East India Company,
    and within seven years he was made head chemist. In time, he completed one of
    his greatest achievements: a chemical that could increase a worker's productivity
    while reducing their need for rest. He was rewarded with a secret laboratory
    beneath a prison camp on Dyer Island.\r\n\nThere, off the coast of India, prisoners
    from the Opium War became his unwilling subjects, leading to a drug that allowed
    soldiers to withstand incredible amounts of pain. Though most side effects were
    minor, there were rumours that a small number of soldiers went mad. In feral
    states, they massacred villages, impaling the populace on bayonets, leaving them
    hanging from trees. There were no official reports on the subject, and Talbot
    refused to blame himself for what could only be exaggerated war stories.\r\n\nThough
    his callous brilliance seemed unflappable, he was ignorant to the enemies his
    questionable work had amassed. The realisation struck him quite literally\u2014with
    a steel pipe to the back of his head during a trip to Mangalore. He was bound
    and loaded into a wagon. When his blindfold was removed, a sickly man showed
    him a mass grave filled with hundreds of bodies. Unbeknownst to Talbot, his productivity-increasing
    drug had killed nearly an entire factory's worth of workers. He knew he couldn't
    defend himself against the anger and accusations of his abductor\u2014all he
    could do was curl up as the blows from the steel pipe rained down. His body was
    thrown into the grave and left for dead. Shifting between consciousness and the
    darkest black, he crawled for an escape, fingers sinking into rotting flesh.
    Black flies feasted on his uncovered skin, the sensation of a hundred pin pricks
    stabbing into him. As he collapsed, he came face to face with a dead woman's
    dazzling hazel eyes. Too weak to pull away, he could do nothing but witness his
    life's work.\r\n\nThen, from the edge of death, he was brought back. He found
    himself on a small bed as a kindly, wrinkled face looked over him. With each
    pained breath, he was nursed back to health in an ancient mystery school posing
    as a monastery. In verdant gardens behind tall, unassuming walls, monks studied
    forbidden texts, striving to expand the human mind in the search for other dimensions\u2014believing
    one to be connected to the other.\r\n\nTalbot's knowledge proved indispensable,
    his mind-altering chemicals integrating seamlessly with theories of neural expansion.
    He realised then that his salvation was no coincidence\u2014he was plucked from
    the pit specifically to advance the school's knowledge. He agreed to help until
    his recovery was complete, being tasked with researching what the monks called
    the soul chemical, a compound derived from the pineal gland that could open the
    mind's eye. What began as a favour to his saviours, soon became an obsession.
    Poring over the school's archives of lost texts, he uncovered scientific formulas
    that confirmed previously unthinkable ideas. He dreamt of ushering humankind
    into a new period of enlightenment. Perhaps then, the nightmares of hundreds
    of dead factory workers\u2014and of those two hazel eyes\u2014would fade from
    his mind.\r\n\nAs he came closer to a breakthrough, the demeanour of the monks
    shifted. The gentle smiles they offered were paired with uneasy eyes that quickly
    darted away when spotted. The polite conversations he was once privy to turned
    to hushed murmurs. The last thing he would see of the school was the cracked
    ceiling above his bed, branching like a dendrite through plaster.\r\n\nHis next
    memories were a shattered mosaic of images and sensations. Smearing lights, horse
    hoofs on cobblestone, coarse burlap scratching at his cheeks, and sharp bites
    into his arm. He awoke ragged and unwashed, splayed on the straw mattress of
    an opium den. Mind in a dense fog, his first thought was of his notes, the only
    record of his groundbreaking revelations. He searched frantically, scrambling
    through the dingy basement, pleading aloud for help. The few other denizens looked
    up from their hammocks, offering nothing but drug-soaked eyes and apathetic gazes
    that soon fell into half-slumber. Before he noticed the robed figure appear behind
    him, a needle plunged into his arm and the world disappeared once more.\r\n\nAwoken.
    Again. Each time, hazier than the last. He tongued at hollow gaps between his
    teeth. How long, he wondered. A faint memory returned. The soul chemical. His
    notes. The verge of a breakthrough. A faraway whisper entered his mind.\r\n\nHe
    fumbled with a stone, sharpening it with shaking hands. In the dim light of the
    den, amongst the catatonic occupants, he carved his research from memory into
    the walls. He wrote for hours until his fingers bled, moving to the floor, taking
    in everything the voice whispered despite his inability to comprehend it. When
    there was nowhere left to write, he gripped the stone and carved the message
    into his chest. Stained with blood, he witnessed a miracle appear before him\u2014a
    magnificent field of lush, orange flowers. The whispered voice beckoned to him,
    urging him to enter the field and discover worlds and dimensions beyond human
    comprehension. For a moment, Talbot felt the sense of wonder he possessed as
    a child.\r\n\nThe denizens of the opium den awoke to silence, the dry scent of
    smoke still lingering in the air. Shambling out of their drug-hazed fog, they
    found the stone floor wet with blood, tiny rivulets coursing through the cracks.
    As eyes adjusted to the darkened room, the jagged lettering scrawled along its
    length began to appear. Written over and over without end, there was but one
    single line: Death is only the beginning."
