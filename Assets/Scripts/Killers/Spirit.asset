  Lore: 'Rin was the only child of the Yamaoka family. She was raised in the dusty
    halls of a traditional house in Kagawa. She studied Education at Takamatsu, a
    private university, which weighed heavily on her family''s shaky finances. Her
    mother got ill that year and the bills started piling up. Rin worked part-time
    in a futile attempt to help lighten the load.


    Her father faced a debt that
    grew without end. He started working double-shifts in hopes of obtaining a promotion.
    That''s when he started losing sleep. A dark whisper would keep him awake all
    night, reminding him of his hopeless situation. Exhausted, he started to lose
    grasp of reality. Fighting to deny what the voice whispered at night, Rin''s
    father made a desperate move. He met with his superior and explained his situation.
    He begged for a bonus, an advance, time-off---anything.


    His request was
    denied. The company had launched a defective production line that was costing
    them dearly. Someone had to be held accountable and Rin''s father fitted the
    bill perfectly. He was fired after twenty-two years of service.


    That evening,
    Rin came home from work. She''d stayed late to entertain customers that lingered
    at the restaurant. As she parked her bike in the shed, she heard her mother''s
    scream come from the house.


    She rushed in, climbing up the stairs to her
    parents'' room. There she found bits and pieces of her mother on the floor. Her
    limbs were clean-cut, tangled up in an unnatural position. Her breasts were sliced
    up, revealing her rib cage, which was cracked open. Rin gagged.


    A sharp
    Katana came crashing down. Rin blocked the blade, which bit into her bare forearm.
    The shock of recognition interrupted her pain: her father was wielding the Katana
    with a stoic expression. She cried out to make him stop, but he slashed her arm
    again.


    She rushed off and slid on the blood-smeared floor. Using the door
    frame as support, she raised herself up. The Katana ripped through the wall,
    cleaving her other arm. She screamed in pain as she limped into the hallway,
    only to be met by her father''s blade.


    She stepped back, trembling, as
    she held together the soft loose flesh of her abdomen. Images of her mother''s
    tangled limbs flashed before her eyes.


    Rin charged at her father, making
    him stumble back. He punched her torn abdomen and she recoiled in pain. As she
    struggled to get back up, he slashed her thigh, making her collapse on the floor.


    As
    she crawled towards the stairs, he grabbed her hair and yanked her against a
    partition. The glass shattered on impact and she fell through, landing one floor
    down.


    She heard footsteps somewhere above her. With effort, she moved,
    worming her way into a sea of broken glass. The shards gnawed at her, ripping
    her flesh. He had to be stopped. He would not get away with what he''d done to
    her--with what he''d done to her mother.


    Coughing up blood, her chin grazed
    the glass, adding to the bleeding. A low-pitched heartbeat started to ring in
    her ears. Her body felt so heavy she could no longer move.


    The ground shook
    with her father''s footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she
    no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.


    A dark
    Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not
    yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.


    An oath was made
    and Rin closed her eyes.'
