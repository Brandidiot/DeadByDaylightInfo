  Lore: "Ji-Woon Hak thrived under the attention of others, energized by every eye
    that watched him and every tongue that spoke his name. Amidst the prestige, he
    had only one desire: more. Even as a child he found ways to draw crowds. Working
    at his family's restaurant, he attracted business with spectacles he performed
    using throwing knives. Gullible tourists believed this was a traditional South
    Korean experience, gladly parting with their money to witness it. Ji-Woon's father
    spent the restaurant's earnings on dancing and vocal lessons for his son, pushing
    him to attain the fame he never could.\r\n\nJi-Woon did not disappoint. After
    years showcasing his abilities to nobodies at talent shows, he hit the track
    to stardom. Yun-Jin Lee, a producer at Mightee One Entertainment, recruited Ji-Woon
    into her training program. He transferred to a dormitory in Seoul where, for
    fourteen hours a day, he was crafted into a star, taught how to move and sing,
    how to carry himself with the right balance of confidence and modesty.\r\n\nDraining
    as the process was, it worked. Yun-Jin selected Ji-Woon to join the band NO SPIN,
    bringing a raw energy to their tracks. Fame was almost immediate. Ji-Woon lived
    in a daze of interviews and adoration, and though the frenzied schedule exhausted
    his bandmates, he was invigorated. Each day was an affirmation that he was greater
    than the mediocrity society spewed out.\r\n\nBut over time, the champagne grew
    stale. When he looked at his fans, he saw their joy and envy split five ways,
    thinned out between each band member. The validation that had surged through
    him left a desperate yearning for more.\r\n\nJi-Woon kept up impressions, mimicking
    a charm long buried under loathing. He recorded the latest NO SPIN album with
    his bandmates, never missing a beat. After a lengthy lunch break, he returned
    to the studio to discover fate had granted him a gift. The scent of burning wires
    was unmistakable. He rushed to the control room, finding the door blocked by
    fallen speakers. On the other side, his bandmates pounded on the door, their
    cries accompanied by the crackling of flames.\r\n\nJi-Woon called to them, dashing
    to the speakers, grabbing one and\u2014stopping. He froze. Each breath was a
    conscious, deliberate process requiring all his attention, the nearby cries hardly
    audible until, slowly, he backed away. And then he heard it. They were screaming
    his name as they burnt. Screaming for him to save them. Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon
    Hak! It was the most beautiful thing he'd ever heard. When the fire crew arrived,
    his tears were genuine.\r\n\nJi-Woon was celebrated as a tragic figure, a hero
    who did all he could in a futile attempt to save his friends. Yun-Jin paraded
    him through interviews until it was time to rebrand. He was reborn as The Trickster,
    a solo artist who produced his own songs, sporting a soft heart beneath a wild
    exterior. But, away from concert set-ups and television stages, something darker
    grew.\r\n\nHe targeted those who lived alone, coming to them in the night. The
    first was a college music student with a captivating voice. Ji-Woon woke him
    with a baseball bat to the skull, binding his arms and legs, gagging him with
    a rag duct taped into his mouth. He tortured him for hours, dissecting him alive.
    Yet there was something missing\u2014a sound, a connection. He wanted to hear
    the victim's wonderous voice pleading as he cut his belly open, but all he received
    was muffled cries through a rag.\r\n\nHe learned and adjusted.\r\n\nVictims had
    to be abducted, driven to an abandoned building where he could let their voices
    carry unrestrained emotion. He made music from them, prodding in the right places
    to evoke different types of shrieks and howls. Stabbing the quadratus lumborum
    elicited a long, guttural wail, while slashing the carotid artery created a sound
    like a cat being strangled. There was honesty in their suffering. Ji-Woon recorded
    each session, synthesizing and working them into his songs, hiding them behind
    layers of melodies.\r\n\nHe was elated with his work. He left hints for police,
    arranging a mink boa from a recent photoshoot around a victim's slashed throat.
    For his next killing, he removed the teeth from a man that a boxer in one of
    his music videos was without. During a particularly audacious plea for attention,
    he killed a fan he had met during a VIP meet-up, replacing her eyes with his
    diamond cufflinks and writing I HAVE SEEN GOD in blood across her chest. Each
    scene was a dazzling spectacle.\r\n\nBetween music and murder, Ji-Woon's work
    was discussed globally. However, as violence became his preferred art style,
    his music career took a hit. Revenue was down and Mightee One executives pointed
    their fingers at him. Yun-Jin, with professional fury, came to his defence, but
    she was outnumbered. It was decided that Ji-Woon could no longer self-produce
    his songs.\r\n\nThe decision was devastating. His tracks fused genuine humanity
    into music, yet executives rejected anything that wasn't generic and expected.
    And so be it. If they couldn't understand his art, he would incorporate them
    into it until they did.\r\n\nHe had three months until he was to perform a private
    show for Mightee One's board members; three months to plan his magnum opus. He
    transferred obscene amounts of money to a veterinarian in exchange for cannisters
    of nitrous oxide, then bribed the stage technician of Mightee One's private theatre
    for access to the room. His celebrity granted him a benefit of the doubt no regular
    person could conceive. When the show was ready, gas seeped into the room as executives
    and stagehands awaited Ji-Woon, conveniently running behind schedule.\r\n\nWhen
    he arrived, half-conscious bodies were splayed in their seats and crawling across
    the floor. He worked quickly, binding everyone, pausing only when he came to
    Yun-Jin\u2014the woman who had plucked him from a mudhole and set him on the
    path he deserved. She would be rewarded, granted special access to the coming
    display of wonder. Even under sedation, she fought, a raging storm within her,
    far stronger than the others. He propped her up as the lone audience member,
    prying her eyes open. The others, snivelling and sobbing, were brought on stage
    to perform their final act. With a contemptable sneer, he slapped makeup onto
    their faces and shone stage lights upon them. They became his instruments.\r\n\nTo
    the sound of self-produced melodies, he tortured them, gracefully dashing from
    one body to another, conducting an operatic crescendo from their wailings. They
    shouted, whimpered, screamed, cried for their loved ones, cried for their mothers.
    It was a magnificent outpouring of emotion, of what it meant to be human, and
    they did it with eyes fixed on Ji-Woon.\r\n\nViscera drained from the stage until,
    with the toss of his throwing knife, the final human instrument fell silent and
    the music stopped. Covered in sweat and blood, an exhausted Ji-Woon looked to
    Yun-Jin and bowed. Curtain call. He had attained perfection. With blade in hand,
    he made his way to Yun-Jin, prepared to tie up loose ends before the credits
    rolled. But as he reached her\u2014\r\n\nThe Fog.\r\n\nFrom where, he didn\u2019t
    know, but it billowed around them, damp, cool... comfortable. He saw the grand
    stage: hospitals and temples, forests and slaughterhouses\u2014an eternal plane
    adorned with rusted hooks, sustained by the million eyes that would watch him,
    run from him, experience him. All he had to do was accept, become an implement
    of The Fog and, most importantly, make them scream.\r\n\nEncore!"
