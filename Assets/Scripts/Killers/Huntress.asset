  Lore: "As soon as Anna was able to walk, her mother started teaching her how to
    survive a harsh, solitary life in the northern woods. Living in such an extremely
    remote and dangerous area required skill and resilience. When sunlight became
    too dim for productive activities, they would take refuge in their house, a sturdy
    old cabin constructed to resist the toughest winters. Close to the hearth\u2019s
    warmth, Anna would rest in her mother's arms, surrounded by the few wooden toys
    and masks she had crafted for her. Drifting off to sleep with stories and lullabies,
    she dreamt happy dreams, ignorant of the events that would soon change everything.\r\n\nAnna
    and her mother were stalking a great elk through the woods. They knew it was
    dangerous prey, but it had been a particularly difficult winter and they were
    almost out of food. The spectre of starvation frightened them more than any forest
    creature. Without warning, the elk reared, bellowed and charged at Anna. She
    was paralysed with fear as the whole world seemed to shake under the immense
    beast\u2019s pounding hooves. The elk was close enough for Anna to see the murderous
    fury in its eyes when her mother threw herself in its path, axe in hand. A blood-curdling
    scream escaped from her lips as the elk impaled her upon its antlers and hoisted
    her into the air. With all her strength, she brought her axe down on its head
    again and again while it tried to shake her loose. With a sickening crack, the
    antlers snapped and Anna\u2019s mother was free. The beast collapsed.\r\n\nAnna
    was too small to move her mother\u2019s broken body, so she sat with her in the
    clearing where she had fallen. To distract her from the dying elk\u2019s cries,
    Anna\u2019s mother held her and hummed her favourite lullaby. They stayed like
    that, the huntress and the elk getting quieter and colder, until Anna was alone
    in the silent forest. Eventually she stood up and started the long walk back
    home.\r\n\nStill a child, she knew just enough about life in the frozen forest
    to survive. She followed her instincts and became one with the wild. She got
    older and stronger and practised her hunt. As she grew into a dangerous predator,
    her humanity became a half-remembered dream.\r\n\nShe widened her territory and
    lived off her hunts. She worked her way up through squirrels, hares, mink and
    foxes. Eventually she grew tired of them and hunted more dangerous animals like
    wolves and bears. When unsuspecting travellers came through her woods, she discovered
    her new favourite prey: humans. Unlucky souls who strayed into her territory
    were slaughtered like any other animal. She liked to collect their tools and
    colourful garments and especially toys when there were little ones. But she could
    never bring herself to kill the little girls.\r\n\nGirls she would take back
    to her house, deep in the woods. They were precious, and looking at them woke
    up something deep in her heart. She craved the closeness of a loved one, a child
    of her own. Among the pillaged wooden toys, dolls and story books she couldn't
    read, the girls would be tied by the neck with a rough and chafing rope fastened
    firmly to the wall. She couldn't let them wander off, or they would surely die
    outside.\r\n\nEvery time, the girls would waste away and die of cold or starvation
    or sickness. Every time, it plunged Anna deeper into pain and sorrow and madness.
    She was compelled to try again, and started raiding the nearest villages to slaughter
    families and kidnap their daughters. She wore one of the animal masks her mother
    crafted for her so many years earlier to try to calm the frightened children.
    Villagers spread the legend of a half-beast lurking in Red Forest: The Huntress,
    who killed men and ate little girls.\r\n\nWar eventually came to the forest.
    German soldiers began to pass through, on the march to attack the collapsing
    Russian Empire. During these dark times, there were no more travellers. The villagers
    had abandoned their homes, and no more little ones to be found; only soldiers.
    Many of them were found with violent axe wounds. Whole groups disappeared mysteriously.
    Once the war was over, the rumours of The Huntress disappeared with it, engulfed
    by the Red Forest."
