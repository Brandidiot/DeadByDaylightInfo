  Name: The Oni
  scrollHeight: 1984.361
  Lore: "Honouring his family name was never enough for Kazan Yamaoka. He wanted
    to surpass his father's reputation and end what he saw as the thinning of samurai
    culture with farmers often posing as samurai. His father tried to turn Kazan's
    attention to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his advice, and borrowing
    his father's Katana, he embarked on a dark pilgrimage to prove his worth and
    rid Japan of impostors. Ignoring the code that had been taught to him, Kazan
    killed impostors in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the woodland.
    The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors
    alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armour. His rage,
    bloodlust and perverse sense of honour knew no bounds. Monks believed he was
    possessed by something dark and otherworldly and cursed him while a noble lord
    began to call him 'Oni-Yamaoka,' the rageful Samurai, an insult both to Kazan
    and his family.\r\n\nDetermined to redeem his family's name, Kazan now butchered
    anyone who dared call him Oni-Yamaoka. The insult confused him. He had defeated
    the best and he had purified the samurai class by ridding the land of impostors.
    How could anyone refer to him as an ogre? Had it been because he had marched
    onto a battlefield to cut down the fiercest warriors. Had it been because he
    had taken a Kanabo and dashed hundreds of skulls with it? Or had it been because
    of his need to secure a 'trophy' from his victims. It didn't matter. Being called
    an ogre was more than he could bear and an ominous voice in his head urged him
    to strike down the lord who had desecrated his name.\r\n\nAs Kazan made for the
    lord's town, he suddenly found himself face to face with a samurai standing on
    a dirt road, blocking his way. Kazan readied his Kanabo. Without a word, the
    samurai attacked and quickly secured the upper hand. But he hesitated. With a
    devastating blow, Kazan crushed the samurai's head and cracked his helmet. As
    Kazan approached the fallen samurai, he saw his father's face and staggered back
    to his haunches. His father stared at Kazan with mingled shame and regret as
    he issued his last breath. Kazan closed his eyes and screamed in agony until
    he could scream no more. When he opened his eyes again... his father was gone.
    Not only had he killed his father, but he had allowed thieves to steal his body
    for armour.\n\nBitter, lost and disillusioned, Kazan roamed the land aimlessly
    with his father's voice rattling in his head, taunting him, reminding him of
    his failures, sending him into fits of uncontrollable black rage. One day, walking
    in the woods, Kazan happened upon an Oni statue. He stopped and stood motionless
    for a long moment. The weathered and overgrown statue seemed to be ridiculing
    him, accusing him of being the impostor samurai he had so desperately sought
    to destroy. Kazan shook the laughing voice out of his head and half remembered
    the lord who had ridiculed him as 'Oni-Yamaoka.\r\n\nWith renewed anger, Kazan
    journeyed to a town high up in the snowy mountains where the lord resided. A
    dozen samurai met Kazan at the gates of the town. A dozen samurai fell to his
    Kanabo. His speed and strength were unmatched. His rage was incomprehensible.
    Covered in blood and gore, Kazan battled through the town and soon found the
    lord hiding in a villa. He dragged him out of a cabinet, sliced his tendons to
    immobilise him and watched him beg and squirm like a dog. Without hesitation,
    he thrust his fist into the lord\u2019s mouth and yanked out the wicked tongue
    that had desecrated his name.\r\n\nSatisfied, Kazan exited the villa to find
    himself surrounded by dozens of farmers wielding rusted scythes, sharp pitchforks,
    and heavy clubs. He survived the first few assaults, but there were too many
    attackers coming from every direction. Within moments Kazan was on the ground
    staring at a cold, indifferent, darkening sky as farmers took turns stabbing
    and torturing the 'Oni' who had butchered their beloved lord. The frenzied mob
    dragged Kazan into a small stone mill to continue the torture and finally left
    him to die a slow, agonising death. When they returned, the mill was filled with
    a strange black fog and Kazan\u2019s body and the Kanabo were nowhere to be found.
    It was the beginning of a dark legend about a rageful Oni haunting the town."
