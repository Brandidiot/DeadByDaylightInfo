  Lore: 'Philip Ojomo came to this country without anything than hope for a new beginning.
    He was happy as he got offered a job at Autohaven Wreckers. A small scrap yard
    where bribed cops turned a blind eye for the somewhat shady business that took
    place.


    Ojomo didn''t care. He had seen criminal activity up close in his
    homeland and as long as he didn''t get involved, he let things be. He just fixed
    cars and handled the crusher. Something he did really well. A car went in and
    a small, metallic cube came out.


    It was not until one gloomy day that he,
    just by accident, saw some blood coming from one of the un-crushed cars. As he
    opened the trunk he found a young man, gagged and with tied hands with panic
    filled eyes. Ojomo freed the man who managed to run ten feet before Ojomo''s
    boss stopped him and slit his throat. As Ojomo demanded answers he got explained
    to him that he''d been nothing more than a simple executioner as more or less
    every car had a soul in them as this was a "service" the scrap yard provided
    to certain "clients".


    Ojomo snapped and went ballistic. He threw his boss
    in the crusher and let it slowly compress, as the head stuck out, Ojomo grabbed
    it and pulled head and spine out of the body. Then he left and was never seen
    again.'
