  Name: The Nurse

  Lore: 'Sally Smithson came to town with dreams of children''s feet and laughter
    in a wooden home built by her husband Andrew. But life came not with smiles but
    with plans of destruction. Andrew worked as a lumberjack - a job with its perils.
    One day, Andrew''s foreman had to pay Sally a visit, forever changing her life.
    She was alone.


    Without food on the table and no other option, Sally had
    to find a way, but the only employment she could get was at the Crotus Prenn
    Asylum. Nobody sought employment there unless they were in dire need. Just like
    Sally. Without any education, she started at the bottom, doing the hard night
    shift.


    Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, two decades of
    seeing horrid things that violate the eyes. Memories that are re-played every
    night. Being abused verbally and physically, by people without limits. Sally
    saw insanity from the outside, just to catch it herself.


    Finally she could
    not take it any more and concepts of purification emerged inside her. She did
    what she felt was necessary. As the morning staff arrived one day in September
    - they found over fifty dead patients, lifeless, in their bed along four staff
    members, also dead.


    Only Sally had survived the night, but her mind was
    gone, rocking back and forth non-stop. Exactly what happened is only known by
    her, but it seems that some of them had been choked as they had marks around
    their necks. They got her into an ambulance, but that ambulance never reached
    the hospital. It was found crashed in a nearby wood, all the staff dead and Sally
    nowhere to be found.'
