  Lore: "A pair of conjoined twins, Charlotte and Victor Deshayes formed an emotional
    bond like none other. The unlikeliness of their successful birth in the 17th
    century could be described as miraculous, yet it immediately brought about their
    life of persecution. The twins emerged with Victor's lower body affixed into
    the chest of his sister, legs twisted around her muscles and organs. He was smaller
    than Charlotte, grown as if he were an appendage of her body rather than a fully
    formed boy. As the newborns screeched, so too did the midwife who delivered them,
    running from the home, yelling of a demon birthed by a witch. So began the hunting
    of Charlotte, Victor, and their mother Madeleine.\r\n\nThe coming years were
    fleeting memories for the twins, yet they were the closest thing to a normal
    life they would know. The journey with their mother was what they believed all
    children underwent, the games of running and hiding through France's countryside
    being an ordinary occurrence. At the age of five, a new challenge to the game
    was presented as their mother fell ill. Pale and exhausted, Madeleine had no
    choice, but to pass responsibility of collecting food onto Charlotte. The girl,
    burdened under extra clothing that concealed Victor's protruding body, set out
    from their forest tent and marched to the nearby town. Though a peculiar sight,
    she did what she had been trained for, waiting for an opening at the market and
    swiping whatever food she could. It was a victory in the game, but one short-lived.\r\n\nAfter
    midnight, glowing flames surrounded the family's encampment, bobbing through
    the darkness. A single commanding shout broke the night's silence and a mob of
    witch hunters streamed in. Grubby hands tore the twins from their bed, Charlotte
    frantically kicking all who approached. Madeleine cried for her children, her
    voice abruptly silenced by a club to her skull. Victor shrieked, the wailing
    of a trapped rat.\r\n\nThe hunters coordinated quickly. A judge on-hand declared
    Madeleine guilty of witchcraft, evidenced by her demon spawn. Within minutes,
    they shackled her unconscious body to a tree, surrounding her feet with dry twigs
    and moss. As she awoke, she did not struggle, only begged her children to turn
    away. They would be given no choice. The twins were forced to watch as the torch
    was lit, and they watched as flames leapt up their mother's skirt, charring and
    sizzling her flesh. They watched as fat dripped from her body, and her face bubbled
    and twisted. They watched until the screams that tore her vocal cords were no
    more, and all that was left was the crackling of embers and a nauseating stench.\r\n\nWhatever
    joy and goodness were in them died with their mother. Caged and transported to
    an old wooden temple, they were sold to a secretive group clad in dark cloaks.
    Victor reacted with the ferocity of a rabid beast at any who approached, clawing
    and biting. The only solace that could calm him was the embrace of his sister.
    Charlotte, bitter and hateful to all but her brother, found purpose in being
    his protector.\r\n\nWithin the temple, they were exposed to unusual experiments
    \u2014 some cruel, many simply baffling. One day they would be made to break
    the neck of a small grey bird. The next, they would bleed their fingers into
    a vase of roses. Every seventh day, they would sleep with the branch of a damp
    oak beneath their pillow. Then there was the chanting: a never-ending chorus
    from cloaked figures on scheduled intervals.\r\n\nIn time, a final experiment
    was planned. Two robed figures herded the twins to the centre of the temple,
    holding Charlotte upon an altar in a room lit with candelabras. The wrinkled
    face of a man peered from under his hood, placing a hand on the forehead of each
    twin, making careful examination of their skulls. Memento mori, he uttered, as
    he withdrew a shining blade.\r\n\nCharlotte rolled to her side, shifting her
    brother off the altar. With a screech, he stretched his arm as far as he could,
    knocking a candelabra to the ground. The flames took to the dry wood immediately.
    They swept over the floor, igniting the black robes that brushed against it.
    Screams of agony pierced the chaos, invigorating Charlotte. She dashed through
    the inferno, vision concealed with nothing, but black smoke and blazing flame.
    A painful heaviness filled her lungs. No exit could be found, every step leading
    to overwhelming heat. She fell to her knees, suffocating, and then saw it \u2014
    sunlight, trees. She stumbled from the fire into dewy grass. Without looking
    back, she ran into the forest until she collapsed.\r\n\nWhen Charlotte opened
    her eyes, she reached for Victor's hand. He made no attempt to budge. His body
    hung helplessly from her torso. She clasped his face, stared into his sad, still
    eyes. The movements she was accustomed to \u2014 his body pulling at her skin,
    his legs prodding at the cavity in her chest \u2014 were no more. Victor was
    dead.\r\n\nCharlotte had no choice, but to continue moving as she mourned, fearing
    black cloaks and witch hunters were prowling. She concealed her brother's corpse
    under her clothing and marched for the sewers of a nearby city. There, she set
    up camp, emerging often to steal whatever food she could, resorting to raiding
    barns for pig slop when desperation set in. Throughout the years, Victor's corpse
    rotted as his limbs oozed and blackened, yet his body demonstrated resistance
    to complete decomposition, as if his sister's blood still coursed through him.
    Protecting his lifeless body became Charlotte's sole reason for being, refusing
    to ever be separated from the only family she had left.\r\n\nLife into her teenage
    years was a game of survival. Her hatred for humanity grew each day under the
    realisation they would never leave her be. No matter how many died during her
    botched robberies and desperate attempts to escape, there would always be more
    to pursue and sling words of condemnation at her \u2014 monster, demon, witch.
    And it was the black cloaks who were the worst of them. Their hunt for her was
    unending, forcing her to constantly abandon shelter and run.\r\n\nFor years,
    Charlotte fled, drawing blood out of necessity, cradling her long-dead brother
    in the night. During a frigid winter, her body began to break down. Food was
    scarce and the refuge of rickety shacks were no use against freezing temperatures.
    Sickle in hand, she sheltered near her campfire in the woods, not knowing if
    the black cloaks would take her before the cold did. As frost crystallised around
    her nostrils and her lips took on a gentle blue hue, Charlotte felt something
    she had never experienced: acceptance. She closed her eyes, opening herself to
    the serenity of death when \u2014 a shriek, shrill and vicious pierced her ears.
    Victor spasmed and flailed from her chest, a cloud of fog encompassing him. Before
    she could react, he spilled from her in a bloody puddle, landing on the snow
    and running.\r\n\nPulling herself from the edge of death, she gave chase. Calling
    his name, she ran through the forest until her legs could hardly carry her, until
    finally, within her view, was Victor, sitting at the edge of a thick fog. His
    face, twisted and feral, screamed as a dark hooded figure emerged from the fog,
    grabbed his arm, and seized him. The serenity that had crept into Charlotte was
    extinguished, replaced with the seething hatred and rage she had depended on
    for so long. With a tight grip on her sickle, she charged into the fog, prepared
    to eviscerate any who set foot near her brother."
