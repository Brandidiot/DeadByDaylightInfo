  Lore: "Frank Morrison was nineteen and had little to show for it. He'd stopped
    attending school after being kicked out of the basketball team for shoving a
    referee into the stands. Yet Frank was a man of potential, who could light up
    a room despite his bleak childhood. At six years old, he'd been taken away from
    Calgary to start a circuit of foster homes. No matter how many times he'd lashed
    out, threw tantrums and got into fights, they'd kept moving him to new, unfamiliar
    houses. His last move had been three years prior when his last foster dad, Clive
    Andrews, had picked him up from the adoption centre. They'd been on the road
    for seven hours before reaching a small bungalow in Ormond. It would be the longest
    time they'd spend together. Clive was too busy trading cheques from Family Services
    for drinks at the bar.\r\n\nOrmond was a small, stale place; a remote town of
    six thousand inhabitants where grey winters drag on for most of the year. Frank
    did everything he could to get into another adoptive family, but he changed his
    mind when he caught the attention of Julie, a beautiful girl who was convinced
    that she deserved better than a life in Ormond, and Frank, as an outsider, was
    her ticket out. Frank attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger
    than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the impulsive Joey, who
    liked to show off, and the shy, na\xEFve Susie, who was Julie's best friend.\r\n\nThey
    would hang out at an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Their time together was
    the perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant everyday
    lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience into
    something powerful. He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their
    limits. Bullying , vandalism, and theft were essentially their weekend plans.
    It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits
    when they put their masks on. One evening, Frank dared Joey to vandalise the
    store that had recently fired him. They snuck inside easily enough, as the building
    was supposed to be empty after closing hours. But a cleaner who was still there
    grabbed Julie as soon as she came near. Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse
    took over Frank. He rushed to her aid, knife in hand, and without hesitating,
    planted the blade into the cleaner's back.\r\n\nAs the group stared at Frank
    in shock, he ordered them to finish the job. Joey clenched his jaw, grabbed the
    knife, and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn't want to do it.
    Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they'd started. Julie closed her
    eyes and slid the knife into the man's chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie:
    they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank
    grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man's throat.
    Frank told them to move fast; they mopped the blood off the floor, stashed the
    body in the trunk of Joey's car, and drove up Mount Ormond.\r\n\nAll four were
    digging in the muddy snow to dispose of the body when Frank spotted something
    moving through the woods. He grabbed his knife and broke from the group to check
    it out. The Fog thickened around Frank, becoming so dense that he soon could
    no longer see ahead. He retraced his steps and stumbled onto an ominous trail.
    He followed the eerie path, as if called by the darkness. Julie, Susie, and Joey
    finished digging, but Frank was nowhere to be seen. Julie spotted his muddy footsteps
    in the snow and the three of them followed the trail, which took them deeper
    into the woods. When Julie, Susie, and Joey did not return home that night, their
    parents thought they'd run away with Frank. Each family came up with a different
    theory. The mood in the town changed, however, when a body was found by an abandoned
    lodge up Mount Ormond."
