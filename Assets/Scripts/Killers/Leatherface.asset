  Lore: "Leatherface kills not from a desire to exert his will over others, to satisfy
    carnal urges, or even to quiet the voices in his head. He kills because he is
    scared. Scared that others will hurt him; scared that his family will be displeased
    with him, scared that their shared willingness to eat human flesh will be discovered.\r\n\nHe
    does as he is told. His family loves him and that is all that matters. Outsiders
    are a threat, and threats need to be dealt with.\r\n\nLike those kids that came
    into the house, uninvited. Walked in like they owned the place. Looked around
    the house, trying to find out his family\u2019s secrets, no doubt. But Leatherface
    deals with them, and protects his family just as he\u2019s been taught.\r\n\nHe
    is not just protector, he has many roles, and each role has its own face. He
    serves dinner, cares for the family, and dresses well when they eat. His Grandpa
    and Ma used to care for them all, but Grandpa, he is old now and Ma has been
    still for a while, so Leatherface and his brothers had to take over. Family is
    everything to him. Family is security and safety.\r\n\nBut, even though he did
    his best, one of the kids got away. He tried to stop her, chasing after her as
    fast as he could, but she had help: another outsider, driving a truck. The evil
    trucker killed his brother, ran him over like he was a possum. In a fury, Leatherface
    leapt at him, the saw ready to avenge his family, but the trucker was too quick.
    He knocked Leatherface aside and turned his own saw against him.\r\n\nAs he watched
    the outsiders driving away, the rage, grief and pain combined with the worry
    about what would happen to his family now. They would surely return with the
    police, and the police would take his brothers, his Grandpa. Without them, what
    would he do? Without their commands, he would wither and die.\r\n\nAs his world
    collapsed, Leatherface spun in circles, swinging the saw all around, trying to
    fight off the myriad external threats that surrounded him.\r\n\nThen another
    feeling overtook him. It came from outside his vision, crawling over his skin
    with cold dread. He realised that no matter what outsiders could do to him, there
    was something worse, something bigger that lived in the shadows. He was filled
    with a terror unlike any he had ever felt before. But it was almost comforting,
    like the fear he'd felt with his family. The fear of disappointing them.\r\n\nHe
    was brought to a place that was familiar but unknowable, and he instinctively
    knew what he had to do. He couldn't fail it, the way he had his family. Outsiders
    would come but he would use his skills to overcome any threats. There would be
    screaming, but he could make the world quiet again. Until the only sound remaining
    was the blessed howl of the saw.\r\n\nLet the outsiders come."
