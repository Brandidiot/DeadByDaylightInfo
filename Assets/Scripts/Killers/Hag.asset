  Lore: "Lisa Sherwood grew up in a quiet village, mainly isolated from the rest
    of civilisation. The people of the hamlet were kind and the elders kept old traditions
    alive, often keeping the peace by personally settling the ever-rare disputes.
    Lisa was particularly fond of the charms they taught her to draw for safety and
    good fortune. One night, as she was walking home through the woods, a terrible
    storm struck without warning. Howling winds whipped at her hair as she stumbled
    through the swamp, her rain-drenched dress plastered to her skin. In the slick,
    wet mud she lost her footing, careening backwards and striking her head against
    rock. Slipping in and out of consciousness, she strained to identify the dark
    shapes approaching her from between the trees. That's the last thing she could
    remember.\r\n\r\nHer kidnappers kept her chained to the wall in a flooded cellar.
    Though dimly lit, she could see others whose large open wounds swarmed with flies.
    It took merely a day before they returned, carving chunks from the prisoners'
    bodies with rusted blades, consuming their very flesh down to the bone. Most
    she saw did not survive long once the cannibals targeted them but somehow, deep
    within, Lisa persisted. Starved, infected, and mutilated after several weeks
    of torture, her gaunt arms became loose in their shackles. She pulled hard, the
    metal tearing through skin and muscle until she was free. Her flesh oozed viscous
    yellow pus and bones were visible beneath gangrenous wounds. She could go no
    further. Delirious, she thought of home; she thought of the elders. With her
    dying breath, she etched the symbols they had taught her into the floor using
    what remained of her fingers. Almost in response, a dark hunger stirred inside
    her. It yearned for blood. In oath, she chose vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe village's
    search party eventually brought them to an old shack in a swamp. Inside, its
    previous inhabitants had been viciously dismembered and devoured by an unidentifiable
    animal. In the cellar, amid rotting corpses and disconnected flesh, the elders\u2019
    charms were scrawled in blood on the floor. Lisa\u2019s body was not among the
    bodies and was never found. The village was never the same again."
