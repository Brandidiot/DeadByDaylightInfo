  Lore: 'The son of wealthy landowners Max Thompson Sr. and Evelyn Thompson, this
    unnamed boy was an unwanted child born to savage parents. Hideously disfigured,
    he was shut away from society. So ashamed of their son, they bricked him off
    into a room and fed him through a hole in the wall. When the boy escaped, he
    took his revenge savagely and terribly, slaughtering the parents that had tortured
    him instead of raising him.


    After the deed was done, he continued to live
    his life at the farm, taking out his deranged violence on the animals that were
    allowed to run free. As he finally broke free from his shackles he ran through
    the cornfields, chasing and slaughtering whatever he could find. They never found
    the bodies of Max and Evelyn, but they did find tortured and disembowelled animals
    all over the farm.


    Coldwind Farm was quickly settled and the land split
    up and sold off. There was never a buyer for the farmhouse. Perhaps it was the
    sound of the chainsaw you could hear throughout those hot summer nights.'
