  Lore: 'Evan MacMillan idolised his father. It wasn''t just that he was heir to
    a great fortune, it was the way he ran the estate. Raised under his firm hand,
    Evan had taken to running the workforce with an iron hand. Production was always
    high and the MacMillan Estate prospered under father and son.



    As Archie
    MacMillan''s mental health slowly disintegrated, Evan protected him from the
    herd who wanted a piece of the fortune. No matter what his father asked of him,
    Evan would do.



    When Archie MacMillan finally snapped, Evan became his
    enforcer in what would become known as the worst mass murder in modern history.
    They never proved that Evan lead over a hundred men into those dark tunnels before
    detonating the explosives and sealing them to their fate. The tale of the MacMillan
    Estate is a tale of wealth and power gone very wrong.



    How many victims
    fell to the hands of father and son is unknown. No record is ever made of what
    became of Evan MacMillan. His father is another unsolved puzzle, found trapped
    in the locked basement of his own warehouse - starved and abandoned.'
