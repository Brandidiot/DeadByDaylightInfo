  Lore: "Born in the dust-ridden badlands of the American Midwest, Caleb Quinn was
    son to struggling Irish immigrants. On the edge of the frontier, sickness, famine,
    and death were common sights, and pioneers contended for whatever scraps they
    could claim while tycoons feasted. Caleb's father, once an engineer, had few
    options to ply his trade as businesses posted a common sign: No Irish Need Apply.
    His antiquated tools laid untouched for years until Caleb uncovered them. Noticing
    his son's interest in the trade, he gifted him his old wrench.\r\n\nThe devices
    Caleb made under his father's guidance had quaint applications, but when his
    father was away, they took a grim turn. He hid plans for a mask that would gouge
    barbed needles into a human's eyes and rip them from their sockets, complete
    with sketches of it fitted on boys who bullied him.\r\n\nWith age, Caleb's engineering
    abilities became marketable and employers put their discrimination aside. Henry
    Bayshore, the owner of United West Rail, hired him.\r\n\nCaleb first invented
    a gun that shot railroad spikes into the ground. Next, he made a steam-powered
    tunnelling drill. But as Bayshore feigned indifference, the devices began turning
    up at other companies, the patents stolen from Caleb and sold.\r\n\nA familiar
    sensation coursed through Caleb's blood, feeding the sharp pain in his heart.
    Rage overwhelming him, he burst into Bayshore's office and smashed his face into
    a bloody stew. As he was pulled away, he pushed his specialised gun to his boss'
    gut and squeezed the trigger. A railroad spike plowed through skin and viscera,
    nailing Bayshore to his desk.\r\n\nThe only thing that saved Caleb from hanging
    was Bayshore's unlikely survival. For fifteen years, Caleb was confined to Hellshire
    Penitentiary, the nation's first private prison. In a fortress of illiterate
    convicts, he found an unlikely friend in the educated prison warden. He designed
    torture devices for him and in return received extra meals. After a time, the
    warden offered to commute his sentence. He spoke of something greater than monetary
    wealth \u2014 political capital \u2014 and that his connections could have Bayshore
    framed and rotting behind bars for life. He had only one request: make him rich.
    Fill the prison. Use ingenuity to bring outlaws in alive.\r\n\nCaleb returned
    to his workshop, and with a few modifications emerged with something new \u2014
    the speargun. The first trial occurred when a thief robbed a Chinese laundry.
    Seizing on the opportunity, Caleb unleashed his prototype. Metal joints screeched
    as the spike shot forward, gouging into the target's abdomen. But as the spear
    tugged, it caught the thief's intestines, and, with an ungodly sound, yanked
    them onto the dusty road. After several iterations, the disembowelments dwindled,
    but Caleb had already earned his new nickname: The Deathslinger.\r\n\nLooking
    to protect his asset, the prison warden pulled strings and released Irish inmates
    to form Caleb's posse. The Hellshire Gang was born. For six years, they roamed
    the country collecting wanted outlaws for the prison, fulfilling their end of
    the bargain. After a bloody battle at Glenvale, Caleb caught notice of a newspaper
    headline: Henry Bayshore Purchases Hellshire Penitentiary. In the picture, a
    disfigured Bayshore proudly shook the warden's hand. Caleb's heart pounded with
    rage, blood swelling as if it would burst from his veins. He'd been sold out,
    a pawn in a rich man's game.\r\n\nThe Hellshire Gang pledged their loyalty to
    Caleb and called for the warden's head. In a thundering gallop, they smashed
    through the prison entrance, shrieking like bloodthirsty marauders. A guard raised
    his pistol, but hesitated. A spear punctured his chest. Caleb grabbed the man's
    head and slammed it against a prison cell until it spilled through the bars.\r\n\nReaching
    the warden's office, Caleb kicked the door and was met with a fortunate sight
    \u2014 it wasn't only the prison warden who cowered in a corner, but Henry Bayshore.
    Overpowered with rage, Caleb rushed to Bayshore, beating, bludgeoning, tearing
    at his flesh. The man's blood dripped from his face, crimson pooling at his feet.
    The Hellshire Gang swarmed the warden, snapping bones with each kick.\r\n\nWith
    the two men broken and begging for death, the posse dragged them to the commons,
    where they were left to the growing crowd of prisoners.\r\n\nSoaked in blood
    and sweat, Caleb hobbled to his old cell, hardly paying notice to Bayshore's
    screams. He sat on the bed's edge as drops of blood ran from his fingertips.
    A thick, unnatural fog streamed through the barred window. He pulled out his
    old wrench, cracked and rusted, and ran a thumb along the metal, regarding it
    with faded eyes. He couldn't remember when it came into his possession. He didn't
    care to remember. At his feet, he saw a dusty path, and, at its end, silhouettes
    of all who had done him wrong: the boys who bullied him, the executives who took
    advantage of him, and, again... Henry Bayshore. Emerging from a fog were the
    tools to dispose of them \u2014 unforgiving steel hooks, brilliant and beautiful
    in their simplicity. Pain tore through his leg as he stood, but he endured, pushing
    onwards, walking the dusty path, leaving a trail of blood flowing behind him."
