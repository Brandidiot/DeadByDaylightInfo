  Lore: 'Kenneth Chase was born in 1932 by a difficult labour, which his mother wouldn''t
    survive. This event drove a rift between him and his father that never closed.
    As the boy grew, so did his father''s resentment, and his drinking habit. By
    the time Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.


    Academically,
    he was unremarkable, coasting by on his significant athletic prowess. He grew
    tall and strong, excelling at track events, but shunned any attempts to coax
    him into team sports.


    On his walk home from school, he would often find
    feathers on the ground and he soon began a collection, keeping them in a cigar
    box under his bed. With his father either at work or in an alcohol-induced stupor,
    Kenneth had hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the feathers''
    barbs and the feeling of softness as he ran them over his lips. Watching the
    birds that came to the feeder in his garden, he imagined how soft they must be
    and resolved to catch one. He ingratiated himself with the local dentist, soon
    procuring some anaesthetic. Using this, he rigged up a trap on the feeder, that
    he hoped would knock out a bird long enough that he could touch it.


    After
    a few failed attempts, he managed to trap a robin. As it lay in his hand, he
    felt a sudden rush, of a life at his mercy. He had planned to release it once
    it recovered from the anaesthetic. Instead, as its eyes flickered back into consciousness
    and it began to struggle, his grip remained firm. His fingers slowly tightened
    around its throat, squeezing until its chest feathers were finally still. He
    disposed of the body, keeping just a feather, with which he started a new collection,
    discarding the others as "fake".


    By the late 1940s, Kenneth had left school
    and started working as a busboy at a local diner. He had also escalated to larger
    prey, like squirrels, raccoons and dogs, becoming skilled at customising the
    anaesthetic dosage for each.


    In early 1954, a young man went missing and
    the town was turned upside down in the search. A few months later, Kenneth''s
    father, while doing some work in the crawlspace under the house, found a cigar
    box. He broke it open and saw, to his horror, that it contained feathers, animal
    paws, and a man''s finger.



    Returning from work, Kenneth saw his father
    leaving the crawlspace with a cigar box in his hands. He turned on his heel and
    never went home again.



    After a few weeks of living rough, he encountered
    a travelling circus and, with his prodigious strength, was hired to work the
    ropes. He assumed a new name: Jeffrey Hawk.


    Suddenly surrounded by a close-knit
    community, "Jeffrey" had to learn to socialise. He donned a new personality like
    a disguise, quickly becoming known as charming and helpful, and was welcomed
    into his new family.


    Over the next decade, he stayed with the circus, travelling
    the length and breadth of the United States. But, with the itinerant life providing
    few repercussions, he fell into bad habits. Drinks, junk food, drugs, he indulged
    in all of them to excess. For a time, these vices were enough, but then his old
    urges returned and his nomadic existence became a cover for him to resume killing.
    He stole clothes and make-up from performers, fashioning a disguise that would
    let him get close to his victims before he anaesthetised them, bringing them
    back to his caravan, where they would awake to find themselves bound and at his
    mercy. He would finally get to have his fun, mentally and physically torturing
    them, their screams fuelling him, before being lost in the night.



    Once
    their strength was at its lowest, he would carefully examine their fingers, searching
    for the prettiest, running them over his tongue to find the tastiest. Once he
    found the best, he would cut it from their hand and proudly add it to his collection,
    disposing of the rest of the body as pointless waste.



    Men, women, young,
    old, he didn''t care. The essence of a good collection is in the variety, in
    the memories and stories they evoke.



    He removed the costume less and less,
    shedding his old personality with it, fully embracing the clown, his true self.


    With
    time, he became complacent and sloppy. A victim managed to work free of her bindings
    while he was sleeping off the drink. She escaped, screaming for help, and he
    awoke to find the rest of the circus bearing down on him. He whipped his horse
    and the caravan disappeared into the night.


    Since then he has roamed the
    country, a parasite who could always be found at a carnival or circus, but who
    would never be seen on any playbill. He lured those brave, or foolish enough,
    to come near, trapped them and moved on before they could be found missing.


    Somewhere
    along the way, he left the ordinary roads of the United States behind him, travelling
    through a veil of mist and entering a new realm. It was a place of transience
    and impermanence, perfectly suiting the life he had chosen to lead. Feeling more
    at home than he had in his entire life, he set up camp and waited for his first
    visitor.'
